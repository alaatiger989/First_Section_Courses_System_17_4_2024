These skills are essential for social success, as they allow for effective communication, problem-solving, and relationship-building. The assessment covers four main domains: practical skills, conceptual skills, social skills, and motor skills, with the motor domain not being included in the total score. The social skills domain evaluates the individual's ability to use social skills in various social situations, and the social emotional skills items within this domain specifically measure the individual's understanding and management of emotions, which are crucial for successful social interactions.\")])\n"
